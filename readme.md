# Guide
hello there,
this is the guide of folder structure of this repo 
here 
1) index.html is the main page
2) every app is an "iframe"
3) content of every app comes from "/apps" folder
4) for window manager "winbox.js" library is used (i've customized it a bit)
5) "/SVG" and "/src" contains icons for the apps
